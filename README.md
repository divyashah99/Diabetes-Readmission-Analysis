# Readmission Analysis for Diabetic Patients

## Project Overview

Diabetes, a prevalent chronic disease and a leading cause of mortality, significantly impacts a large population. Hospital readmission, the need for a patient with diabetes to return within a specific timeframe, is more likely for those previously hospitalized. This project aims to predict diabetic patient readmission using diverse medical data, sourced from the UCI machine learning repository.

## Project Objective

The primary goal is to predict whether a diabetic patient will experience readmission by analyzing factors such as age, gender, admission type, diabetic medications, duration of hospitalization, and laboratory results. The labeled dataset used for this analysis provides readmission status for each patient record. The project utilizes machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and make predictions, contributing valuable insights for improving hospital care.

## Project Scope

The project's scope ranges from extracting insights through exploratory analysis to implementing a suitable machine learning model for making predictions on the data. The analysis aims to assist hospitals in identifying factors contributing to higher readmission rates, thereby enhancing the quality of care and adjusting medication protocols.

## Methodology

### Exploratory Analysis

- Visualizations are employed to uncover data distribution, identify discrepancies, outliers, and missing data.
- Data wrangling techniques address missing values and reduce dimensionality by eliminating unnecessary columns.

### Feature Engineering

- High-level techniques, including feature selection and engineering, are applied to identify the most effective set of features for training the machine learning model.

### Model Training and Validation

- The dataset is split into two sets: one for training the model and the other for validating the results.
- Three machine learning models are explored, with logistic regression identified as the optimal model, achieving a 92% accuracy in predicting readmitted patient records.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the UCI machine learning repository. It is a labeled dataset, providing the readmission state for each patient record.
